# InsertionSortProject

## Write the stages of the above given sequence according to the sort type.
2,27,16,22,18,6  n

2,6,16,22,18,27  n-1

2,6,16,18,22,27  n-2

## Write the Big-O notation.
n(n-1)/2 = (n^2+n)/2 = O(n^2)

## Time Complexity:
Average case: The number we are looking for is in the middle.

Worst case: The number we are looking for is at the end.

Best case: The number we are looking for is at the beginning of the series.

## What case does the number 18 fall into after the array is sorted?
Average case because it is in the middle.
